HOW TO SEE THE SITE ON YOUR COMPUTER
=====================================

DO THIS (in order):

1. Double-click: RUN-FIRST.command
   (It's in this same folder: "Pest Control site")

2. If Mac says "cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer":
   - Right-click RUN-FIRST.command
   - Click "Open"
   - Click "Open" again in the dialog

3. A black Terminal window will open. Wait until you see:
   "SERVER IS RUNNING" and "Site URL: http://localhost:3006"

4. Your browser should open by itself. If it doesn't:
   - Open Chrome or Safari
   - Type in the address bar: localhost:3006
   - Press Enter

5. KEEP THE TERMINAL WINDOW OPEN the whole time you're viewing the site.
   If you close it, the site will stop loading.

6. When you're done: close the Terminal window or press Ctrl+C in it.


IF IT STILL DOESN'T WORK
------------------------

A. Make sure Node.js is installed:
   - Open Terminal (Spotlight: type "Terminal", press Enter)
   - Type: node -v
   - Press Enter
   - You should see something like v18 or v20. If you see "command not found", install Node from https://nodejs.org

B. Run the steps manually in Terminal:
   1. cd "/Volumes/Extreme SSD/Pest Control site"
   2. npm install
   3. npm run dev
   4. Wait for "Ready" and "Local: http://localhost:3006"
   5. Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:3006
   6. Keep the Terminal window open

C. If you see "Port 3006 is in use":
   - Something else is using that port. Close other apps or restart your Mac, then try again.
